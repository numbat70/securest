If they don't then it is very bad  Our language is often meaningless or confusing to our customers</p> Content <p>People expect \"Guide\" style content that educates them on the topic.  SE.COM merely sent them towards applications, events or contacts</p> <p> Confused Persona's expected more general explanatory content and did not like the streamlined Service Summary &gt; Eligibility &gt; Apply funnel  Convinced Person's did appreciate the Service Summary &gt; Eligibility &gt; Apply funnel as they were already sold on the services.</p> Case Studies <p>They are great when they are quite specific and match the circumstances of the user.  This means that people want to see Case Studies of companies like them, that have the same issues as them. Generic Case studies don't work as well.  This suggests that Case Studies are used Deeper in the site once users have self selected who they are and what they need.  They are better for Confused Personas and act as part of the decision making process.</p> Campaign Pages/Sites <p>Campaign content tends to work better as they are more focussed. They represent the ideal situation where all the content is focussed on just one journey.  On normal websites the content is trying to do everything at once.  This shows the two extremes of lost itpeok vs Curated Journey Content</p> Search <p>It's not hard...but we get it wrong anyway.  Search needs to be prominent and not hidden behind fancy UX/UI Search needs to work Search needs to work how people expect it to.  -Read the Search and Filter section for more detail across all our testing</p> Registration and Login <p>This is a minefield Only ask people to Register when it is very clear what the benefit will be for them Don't hide stuff behind a Login just to justify making them register. People will find this annoying and it erodes trust. Make your screens clearly delineate Registration vs Login.  Don't get clever. It almost never works.  Add Simplicity. You want people to be thinking as little as possible and just concentrating on One Thing when they register.  Example: \"I am giving you my details to creat an Account so that I can apply for this grant\" Gradual engagement is great...as long as people understand that it is gradual engagement and not a trap.  People are happy enough to use 3rd party signin such as Google, Facebook, LinkedIn as long as they are 100% certain what it is for and the limits of what info is used/shared/exposed</p> Design <p>Colours: People view Colours\ud83c\udfa8 as having meaning. Use them wisely.  Text Blocks: Large blocks of text are hard to read. Use Headings and Lists to create a scannable hierarchy of information Images: Different people interpret images in different ways. Test images extensively. </p> Actions <p>Improve the visibility of the existing filter  Make the search visible in the header area  Simplify the login page  Involve your target users in the design process to flesh out User Journies  \"Industry\" needs to be improved.
